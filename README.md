# Firma

A Python equivalent of the R Terra package for spatial data science, with a focus on raster data. Firma is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use.

As a R native, I have found that working with spatial data in Python is very fragmented and tedious, compared to the ease of use of the Terra package in R, which can do almost anything with spatial data. I have therefore decided to create a Python equivalent of the Terra package, which I have named Firma (because Terra Firma).

## Firma Goals

The main goals of Firma are:

* To provide a single, easy to use package for all spatial raster and vector data science tasks.
* Maximal file format support, including GeoTIFF, NetCDF, HDF, GRIB, and more.
